# Baseball Players Data Visualization Project 

We analyzed a dataset of 1,157 baseball players through four major characteristics including BMI, handedness, batting average and home run performance.   

Using Tableau, the objective of this investigation is to find visual evidence that a baseball player's BMI and handedness can be a determinant in its performance measured by its batting average and number of home run.
